            <p>You served your country with honor.</p>
            
            <p>Now you're ready to build something of your own... but every time you try to crack the government contracting code, you hit another wall.</p>
            
            <div class="pain-point">
                <strong>Sound familiar?</strong> You've spent hours on SAM.gov only to get lost in a sea of confusing forms. You've watched YouTube videos that promise "easy government money" but leave out the critical details. You've even paid for courses that gave you generic advice without showing you the actual screens, the real templates, or the insider moves that separate winners from wannabes.
            </div>
            
            <p>Meanwhile, you're watching other contractors land $50K, $100K, even $500K+ deals...</p>
            
            <p>While you're still stuck trying to figure out what a UEI number even IS.</p>
            
            <p>Here's what nobody tells you: <span class="bold">The government contracting space isn't hard because the rules are complicated...</span></p>
            
            <p><span class="bold italic">It's hard because you're trying to navigate THREE completely different systems at once.</span></p>
            
            <p>And if you don't master all three? You'll never graduate from being a small-time vendor to becoming a <span class="caps bold">real contractor</span> with recurring, high-dollar deals.</p>
            
            <p>But what if I told you there's a way to cut through all the confusion... and position yourself as a serious player in 90 days or less?</p>

            <h2>How a Retired Signal Officer Cracked the "3-Tier Code"</h2>
            
            <p>Seven years ago, I was exactly where you are now.</p>
            
            <p>Retired from the Army. Ready to build something. But completely lost when it came to government contracting.</p>
            
            <p>I tried everything: attended expensive seminars, bought course after course, even hired a consultant who charged me $3,000 to basically Google search contracting opportunities for me.</p>
            
            <p><span class="bold">Nothing worked.</span></p>
            
            <p>That's when I had my breakthrough moment...</p>
            
            <p>I was sitting in a coffee shop, frustrated after another failed attempt at understanding sub-contracting, when I overheard two contractors talking. One was complaining about only getting small federal jobs. The other was bragging about his corporate contracts with major companies.</p>
            
            <p>It hit me like a lightning bolt: <span class="italic">They weren't competing in the same space at all.</span></p>
            
            <p>Most contractors focus on just ONE tier - usually federal - and wonder why they're stuck fighting for scraps.</p>
            
            <p>But the contractors making REAL money? They play in all three arenas:</p>
            
            <p><span class="bold">Federal contracts</span> (the big, prestigious deals everyone talks about)</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Local contracts</span> (the steady, relationship-based work nobody mentions)</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Corporate contracts</span> (the hidden goldmine that most veterans never even know exists)</p>
            
            <p>That night, I mapped out what would become the 3-Tier Contractor System...</p>
            
            <p>Within 18 months, my company 4SYT Industries was pulling contracts from all three tiers. Federal maintenance contracts. City buildout projects. Corporate facility management deals.</p>
            
            <p>Today, we're not just surviving - we're thriving across multiple revenue streams because we refused to put all our eggs in one contracting basket.</p>

    <section class="section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>The 3-Tier Contractor System That Changes Everything</h2>
            
            <p>Here's what I discovered: The contractors making six and seven figures aren't smarter than you.</p>
            
            <p>They just understand something most people don't...</p>
            
            <p><span class="bold">Each tier has its own language, its own systems, and its own secret handshakes.</span></p>
            
            <h3>Tier 1: Federal Mastery</h3>
            <p>This is where everyone starts... and where most get stuck. SAM registration, NAICS codes, past performance records. Yes, it's complex. But once you know the exact steps (and I mean EXACT - down to which buttons to click), you can position yourself for contracts worth hundreds of thousands.</p>
            
            <h3>Tier 2: Local Goldmine</h3>
            <p>Here's what shocked me: Cities and counties often have LESS competition than federal contracts. Why? Because most contractors never figure out how to find local solicitations. I'll show you the three websites that 90% of contractors never check... where contracts are practically waiting for qualified bidders.</p>
            
            <h3>Tier 3: Corporate Contracts</h3>
            <p>The hidden tier. Major corporations need facility maintenance, security services, and specialized work. But they don't advertise on government sites. I'll reveal the supplier portals and certification programs that open doors to steady, high-paying corporate work.</p>
            
            <p>When you master all three tiers, something incredible happens:</p>
            
            <p><span class="bold">You're no longer dependent on any single source of revenue.</span></p>
            
            <p>Federal contract delayed? Your local work keeps you going.</p>
            <p>City budget cuts? Your corporate contracts pick up the slack.</p>
            <p>Corporate client changes direction? Your federal pipeline keeps flowing.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't theory. This is exactly how 4SYT Industries has built a bulletproof contracting business over the past seven years.</p>
            
            <div class="testimonial">
                "The 3-tier approach completely changed my perspective. I was only looking at federal contracts and getting nowhere. Now I have active bids in all three areas and landed my first corporate contract last month."

            <h2>Questions From Serious Contractors</h2>
            
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Q: "I'm brand new to government contracting. Will this work for someone with zero experience?"</h4>
                <p>Absolutely. The system is designed to take you from complete beginner to competent contractor. I start with the basics and build up to advanced strategies. Plus, the coaching ensures you never get stuck.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Q: "I've tried other government contracting courses before and they didn't work. How is this different?"</h4>
                <p>Most courses give you generic theory. This gives you my actual process, with real screen recordings, actual templates, and ongoing support. Plus, the 3-tier approach means you're not putting all your eggs in the federal contracting basket.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Q: "What if my business isn't in facilities maintenance? Will this still apply?"</h4>
                <p>Yes. The 3-tier system works for any service-based business that can contract with government and corporate clients: IT services, security, consulting, construction, professional services, and more.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Q: "How much time will I need to dedicate to this?"</h4>
                <p>The video content is 7.5 hours, which you can complete at your own pace. Implementation takes 2-3 hours per week for most contractors. The key is consistency, not marathon sessions.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Q: "What if I can't afford the full payment right now?"</h4>
                <p>Payment plans are available for qualified contractors. During your consultation call, we'll discuss options that work for your situation.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq">
                <h4>Q: "Is this just for veterans, or can non-veterans benefit too?"</h4>
                <p>While there's specific content for leveraging veteran status, the 3-tier system works for any entrepreneur serious about government and corporate contracting. The core strategies are universal.</p>
